# mandebrotSet-Arrays
Generate the Mandelbrot Set by giving inputs on the resolution, the max number of iterations, and the region of the complex plane on which you'd like to generate on. The program uses MATLAB and its arrays to store data of each corresponding point and printing it all at the end. This saves lots of time because the printing process is slow.
